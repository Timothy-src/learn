    <div class="lyrics">
  When I was a young boy<br>
  My father took me into the city<br>
  To see a marching band<br>
  He said, "Son, when you grow up<br>
  Would you be the savior of the broken,<br>
  The beaten and the damned?"<br>
  <br>
  He said, "Will you defeat them?<br>
  Your demons and all the non-believers,<br>
  The plans that they have made?"<br>
  <br>
  "Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom<br>
  To lead you in the summer,<br>
  To join the black parade."<br>
  <br>
  When I was a young boy
  My father took <br>
  me into the city
  To see a marching band.<br>
  <br>
  He said, "Son, when you grow up<br>
  Would you be the savior of the broken<br>
  The beaten and the damned?"<br>
  <br>
  Sometimes I get the feelin'
  She's watchin' over me<br>
  And other times I feel like I should go<br>
  And through it all, the rise and fall<br>
  The bodies in the streets<br>
  And when you're gone, we want you all to know.<br>
  <br>
  We'll carry on, we'll carry on<br>
  And though you're dead and gone, believe me<br>
  Your memory will carry on<br>
  <br>
