<div class="lyrics">
  Slip back out of whack at your best<br>
  It's a nightmare<br>
  So I'm joining the army<br>
  <br>
  No house phones, but can I still call?<br>
  Will you wait for me now?<br>
  We've got the right to live, fight to use it<br>
  Got everything but you can just choose it<br>
  I won't just be a puppet on a string<br>
  <br>
  Don't go that way<br>
  I'll wait for you<br>
  <br>
[Chorus 1]
  And I'm tired of all your friends<br>
  Listening at your door<br>
  I want what's better for you<br>
  So long, my friend and adversary<br>
  But I'll wait for you<br>
  <br>
  Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest<br>
  Are you okay?<br>
  I've been all around this town<br>
  Everybody's been singing the same song for ten years<br>
  <br>
